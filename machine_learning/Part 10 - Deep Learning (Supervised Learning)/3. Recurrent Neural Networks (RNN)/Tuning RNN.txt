Remember, this time we are dealing with a Regression problem because we predict a continuous outcome (the Google Stock Price).

Parameter Tuning for Regression is the same as Parameter Tuning for Classification which you learned in Part 1 - Artificial Neural Networks, the only difference is that you have to replace:

scoring = 'accuracy'  

by:

scoring = 'neg_mean_squared_error' 

in the GridSearchCV class parameters.
